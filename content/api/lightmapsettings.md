### Description



Stores lightmaps of the Scene.





A Scene can have several lightmaps stored in it, and [Renderer](Renderer.html) components can use those
lightmaps. This makes it possible to use the same material on multiple objects, while
each object can refer to a different lightmap or different portion of the same lightmap.
