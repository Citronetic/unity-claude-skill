### Description



A linked list version of [IObjectPool<T0>](Pool.IObjectPool_1.html).





Object Pooling is a way to optimize your projects and lower the burden that is placed on the CPU when having to rapidly create and destroy new objects. It is a good practice and design pattern to keep in mind to help relieve the processing power of the CPU to handle more important tasks and not become inundated by repetitive create and destroy calls.
The LinkedPool uses a linked list to hold a collection of object instances for reuse. Note this is not thread-safe.
