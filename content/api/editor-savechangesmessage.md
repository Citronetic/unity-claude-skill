                    public string saveChangesMessage;






### Description



The message that displays to the user if they are prompted to save.





Set saveChangesMessage in a derived class to prevent users from accidentally losing unsaved work. For saveChangesMessage to work, you must use it with [Editor.hasUnsavedChanges](Editor-hasUnsavedChanges.html) and override the [Editor.SaveChanges](Editor.SaveChanges.html) method.
This message shows exactly as you have written it. This message presents to users who have unsaved changes, if they attempt to close the Inspector, change Selection or enter Playmode.
The save changes message might combine with other messages from other editors. This occurs if there are multiple editors that have unsaved changes.
