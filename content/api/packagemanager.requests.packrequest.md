### Description



Represents an asynchronous request to pack a package folder.





The PackageManager [Client](PackageManager.Client.html) class returns a [PackRequest](PackageManager.Requests.PackRequest.html) instance when you call the [Client.Pack](PackageManager.Client.Pack.html) method.  Use this object to determine when the request is complete and to access the result.

                Once the request is complete, you can retrieve the PackageOperationResult instance from the Result property.
