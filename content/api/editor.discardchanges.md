## Declaration

public void DiscardChanges();






### Description



Discards unsaved changes to the contents of the editor.





Override DiscardChanges() to discard unsaved work when an editor is closed.
                When you override this method, call the base implementation. Otherwise the [Editor.hasUnsavedChanges](Editor-hasUnsavedChanges.html) property is not reset to false.
                Note, if the Editor has multiple prompts to the user to discard their changes, the Editor will call this method as part of a list of changes that need to be discarded.
                If this method throws an exception, Unity cancels the discard process for all remaining prompts. In that case, a dialog box displays an error message with the exception message.
