# Add ambient occlusion in the Built-In Render Pipeline

**Ambient occlusion**A method to approximate how much ambient light (light not coming from a specific direction) can hit a point on a surface.
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Ambientocclusion) (AO) is a feature that simulates the soft shadows that occur in creases, holes, and surfaces that are close to each another. These areas occlude (block out) **ambient light**Light that doesn’t come from any specific direction, and contributes equal light in all directions to the Scene. [More info](lighting-window.html)
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Ambientlight), so they appear darker.

It works by approximating how much ambient light can hit a point on a surface. It then darkens creases, holes and surfaces that are close to each other.

You can use ambient occlusion to add realism to your lighting.

## Baked Ambient Occlusion

If **Baked **Global Illumination**A group of techniques that model both direct and indirect lighting to provide realistic lighting results.
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#globalillumination)** is enabled in your **Scene**A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene), Unity can bake ambient occlusion into the **lightmaps**A pre-rendered texture that contains the effects of light sources on static objects in the scene. Lightmaps are overlaid on top of scene geometry to create the effect of lighting. [More info](Lightmapping.html)
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Lightmap). This is known as **Baked Ambient Occlusion**.

To enable baked ambient occlusion in your Scene:

1. Open the **Lighting** window (menu: **Window** > **Rendering** > **Lighting**)

2. Navigate to the **Mixed Lighting** section

3. Enable **Baked Global Illumination**

4. Navigate to the **Lightmapping Settings** section

5. Enable **Ambient Occlusion**

## Realtime ambient occlusion

If Global Illumination is not enabled in your Scene but you still want the effect of ambient occlusion, you can use a **post-processing**A process that improves product visuals by applying filters and effects before the image appears on screen. You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties, for example Bloom and Depth of Field. [More info](PostProcessingOverview.html) post processing, postprocessing, postprocess
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#post-processing) effect to apply real-time ambient occlusion to your Scene.

If ****Enlighten**A lighting system by Geomerics used in Unity for Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination. [More info](https://www.siliconstudio.co.jp/en/products-service/enlighten/)
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Enlighten) Realtime Global Illumination** is enabled in your scene, the resolution for indirect lighting does not capture fine details or dynamic objects. We recommend using a real-time ambient occlusion post-processing effect, which has much more detail and results in higher quality lighting.

For information on real-time ambient occlusion post-processing effects, see [post-processing effects](PostProcessingOverview.html).
